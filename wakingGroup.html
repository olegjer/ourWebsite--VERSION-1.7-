      <p>
        It’s easy to forget that walking is even considered as exercise given how ingrained it is in the day-to-day of able-bodied people, but it does more for your fitness than you might think. It’s one of the most accessible forms of exercise, generally requiring at most comfortable clothes and shoes. Considered light-to-moderate exercise, you can easily burn 200-350 calories an hour just by going for a stroll, and this number can be heightened by increasing the intensity of the walk with methods such as speed-walking and incline-walking. It’s an incredibly beneficial form of exercise to implement in your day-to-day, increasing cardiovascular fitness, muscle power, bone strength, and stamina with as little as 30 minutes of walking a day. As well as all of those benefits, it can also reduce the risk of developing heart disease, type-2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and even some forms of cancer. Along with all that, it’s also been known to help lower cholesterol, and assist those suffering from hypertension, and joint/muscle pain and stiffness in managing those issues. Walking is a great thing to implement in anyone’s fitness routine, as it can be a solo activity for those looking to put some headphones on and focus, as well as a social activity, with walking groups becoming increasingly popular as a way to connect/catch-up with friends while keeping fit. If you’re looking to improve your general fitness, implementing walking into your daily routine is a cakewalk!
